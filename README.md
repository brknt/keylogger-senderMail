Keyloggers are a programmed type tracking software designed to record keystrokes
made by a user.One of the oldest forms of cyber threat, this key recorder saves the
information you write on a website or app and sends it back to a third party.In this
way, the user's information is compromised.However, there are legitimate uses in
businesses to troubleshoot issues, improve user experience, or monitor
employees.Keyloggers often come bundled with other malware as part of a wider
attack.Many keyloggers now come with ransomware, cryptocurrency mining or
botnet code attached, which can be activated at the attacker's discretion.
